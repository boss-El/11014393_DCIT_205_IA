       <h4>ULTTA Shapes Quality Assurance in University of Ghana's Laboratories</h4> 
        
        - Stay informed about recent college developments with our news section.
        - ULTTA conducted a three-day workshop themed "Assuring Quality of Laboratory Results in A World Class Research
        Intensive University" from August 16-18, 2023. The event, held at the Adzei Bekoe Science Conference Hall in the
        Department of Biochemistry, Cell, and Molecular Biology, focused on enhancing the competency of laboratory staff under
        the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (SPMS). Prof. Larry P. Chegbeleh, representing the Dean of SPMS,
        emphasized the importance of quality management systems, commending ULTTA's leadership. Ms. Mawuena Abortta, SPMS School
        Administrator, stressed the need for best practices and relevant training for laboratory technicians and technologists.
        Mrs. Joyce Duah, interim chairperson of ULTTA-UG, highlighted the significance of ISO/IEC 17025 standard, a global
        benchmark for laboratory quality management. The workshop, featuring professionals from Ghana Standard Authority and
        Quality Control Company, provided valuable insights, promoting the competency of laboratory staff. ULTTA executives seek
        university management support for accrediting pivotal laboratories, aligning with the university's modernization and
        internationalization drive. The workshop proves to be a valuable initiative in elevating laboratory staff competencies.
